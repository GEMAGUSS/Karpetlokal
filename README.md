## About me
I'm a software developer who loves building things that solve real problems — from web apps and APIs to automation and tooling. I contribute to open source, enjoy clean architecture and good tests, and I learn fast by shipping small, iterative improvements.

- 🔭 Currently building: meaningful projects and improving developer workflows  
- 🌱 Always learning: new languages, patterns, and best practices  
- 💬 Ask me about: engineering tradeoffs, clean code, and design that scales  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I prefer small, elegant solutions over overengineered ones

- I collaborate through issues, PRs with context, and constructive code reviews.

<!-- Top languages -->
![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=GEMAGUSS&layout=compact&theme=radical)

(These use third-party services — tell me if you want them added and whether you prefer a specific theme.)
